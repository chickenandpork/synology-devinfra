# Example nomad agent config file for a client-only connection to an advertised nomad in server mode.
#
# This leverages the expected mDNS advertisement to find the nomad server.  We may choose to use
# the "advertise" block in the config, but these are really indications of where to connect once
# the server is found: "yo, you connected to me, but <redirect> really use {this} IP/port".  The
# "advertise" block makes little sense in a client-only mode, since there should likely be no
# second-order client connecting through to the server.
#
# this example server_join matches the data published to mDNS (Avahi, DNS-SD) by the server config.
